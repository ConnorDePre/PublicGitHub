# MODULE-LEVEL (GLOBAL) SCOPE — runs once per execution environment
#
# Everything here executes during the cold start Init Duration and
# is never repeated on warm invocations. This is where you put
# anything expensive to initialize: boto3 clients, DB connections,
# config loading — anything that should be reused across calls
# rather than rebuilt on every invocation.
#
# env_create_time is a simple observable example: it records when
# this execution environment was created. Watch it in the API
# response — it stays frozen across warm calls and only resets
# when Lambda creates a new environment (cold start).
